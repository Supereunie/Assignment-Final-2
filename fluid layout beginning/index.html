    Come visit the new greenhouse and check out the colonies with our recently acquired exotic species.
    If you need a specific type of plant for your landscaping project, we can create a new cultivar to your specifications.
    No project is too big or small. We can populate an entire botanical garden or create a one-of-a-kind greenhouse. 
    Be the first to grow a tree of unknown origin.

  <h3>Cloning species</h3>
    
    Horticulture cloning refers to generating descendants of a single plant by vegetative reproduction. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, that have been derived from a single individual, and then multiplied by a process other than sexual reproduction. For example, some strains of European grapes are clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples of clones are the potato and banana plants.
    Grafting is a technique that is similar to cloning, because the shoots and branches from the graft result in the creation of a genetic clone of a single individual plant. However, this type of cloning is typically classified as an entirely different kind of operation.
